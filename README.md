## Description

In a level of Flippy Fish, the player moves a fish to a goal via numerous jumps. The fish has a water meter that depletes when out of water, so ponds and water sources act as intermediate goals. Along the way are hazards that, if touched, send the fish back to the latest pond.

Flippy Fish contains 10 levels:

- 3 Factory levels
- 3 City levels
- 3 Forest levels
- Beach level

The level selection menu is fully unlocked from the start.

No external code libraries were used in this project.
