Primary Project Responsibility: Ensuring team communication, developing the power bar script

Code contribution:

The first piece of code that I contributed to the Flippy Fish project was the power bar script where I was the sole developer meaning that I developed the entire script with no input from any other of the team’s developers.
The second part of the project that I contributed to was the Fish movement script. I contributed to some of this script where I created code that helped to enable the power bar functionality. This mainly involved the instantiation of the power bar class from within the fish movement script and making calls to the power bar class when appropriate.

Power bar script description:
The game of flippy fish involves the player controlling a fish that flips and flops through a level with the goal of reaching the end safe zone. The player controls the fish via the left click which, when held charges a jump, this jump can also be cancelled by right clicking. When the player releases the left click the fish is propelled up and forward and into the air. The power bar script itself is responsible for providing feedback to the user regarding the power of their jump. Feedback is required as the power level of the fish’s jump is not consistent, rather when holding left click the power of the fish’s jump varies from high to low, creating a skill aspect where players must time the release of the left click with the goal of achieving the highest-powered jump. The power bar script I created controls the power bar and is responsible for determining the core difficulty of the game. The power bar script behaviours in the manner of accelerating upward and then de-accelerating downward.

Why I found the power bar interesting:

The power bar script represents the largest contribution I made to the group project and is the contribution that I found most interesting. I found the power bar interesting due to the importance of the power bar script and how it is one of the main factors in determining the difficulty of the game. Because of the importance of the power bar and how integral it was to the balance of the game I I had to spend a lot of time fine tuning the power bar and gaining player feedback so that an appropriate level of difficulty was achieved, this process of balancing the game is what I found interesting about the power bar script.

Why I am proud of my power bar script:

I am proud of my power bar script as I believe it follows a very logical, simple, straight forward structure that is flexible enough to allow for future rebalancing and modification. The script has also been written in a manner which makes it easy for future developers to delve into the code and understand it. I believe the script is well-written as I have made sure that:
* All variable names are self-documenting
* Access modifiers are used in the appropriate manner which helps to reduce the risk of accidental manipulation of the power bar script. For example, the UpdateCharge() method is only used within the power bar script itself and as such has the private access modifier instead of the public modifier.
* Comments are well placed and well written

Reflections:

I believe that this project has developed my ability to lead and organise a team of multi-disciplined individuals as throughout this project I took the initiative on organising and leading team meetings as well as co-ordinating discussion between the designers and the developers. What I learnt from this experience is that communication is strongest when there is free flowing natural discussion instead of strict lines of questioning. For example, at the beginning of the project I tried to initiate discussion by questioning the designers about what they wanted out of the developers by asking questions such as “Do you have any work for us?”. These types of questions are very poor at stimulating discussion as they single out people and make them feel uncomfortable and out of their depth. I now realise that the best way to have a team meeting is to not question and target individuals but to create a friendly environment where no one is afraid to throw out their ideas, this way ideas can be discussed and developed until they are at a point where work can be formed form the ideas.
This project has also taught me about the importance of consistency when it comes to contributing to a group project. Throughout the course of this project I felt as if my own contribution was inconsistent, this was because I did not realise the consequences of inconsistent contribution in relation to a group project.

Initially I believed that If I did not contribute any work within a week but made up for it in the following week by contributing double the amount of work then no harm was done. The issue that I ran into was that if I did not contribute for a week then my lack of understanding of the project did not stay the same, it became relatively smaller. This is because of the dynamic of a team and how if the team contributes work within a week and you do not then your own understanding of the project is now smaller than what it was. For example, I may understand three lines of code out of ten, however after a week of no contribution I would now only understand three lines out of fifteen. This led to a situation where not only did I not have a good understanding of the project, but I had so much work to make up for that it was overwhelming.
One final thing that this project has taught me is the importance of correctly setting up a development environment. Upon reflection I realise that one of the major reasons I failed to complete work in a timely manner was because I did not bother to correctly configure and establish my development environment in a manner which streamlined my work flow. I now realise that I should have taken the time to:
*	A link between unity and my text editor so that functionality such as auto-completion and the ability to right click on a function and be brought to the unity documentation was available
*	An understanding of unity so that playtesting was streamlined in a manner where if I was testing a specific part of a level, I did not have to play the whole level from the beginning to get to that part

This poor configuration of my development environment led to me spending a lot of time simply searching unity documentation and playing flippy fish instead of developing the game. The key learning point here is that in future I will take the time to recognise what my development environment is and correctly configure it to eliminate time-consuming repetitive actions that do not aid in development.

Most important takeaway:

I believe that the most important thing I learnt from completing this project is that one must have passion for the goal of a project if they want to be able to contribute in a meaningful manner. Unlike other projects that I have undertaken at university, flippy fish was the first project where I did not have a passion for the final product, not that I don’t like the game, I believe flippy fish is an awesome game with a great art style, however I simply do not have a passion for video games. Currently I do not play video games, and neither am I involved in the community. 
Initially I thought that my lack of passion for video games would not be an issue as I am the type of person who gets fully immersed in the problem solving process, so I assumed that once I had work to do it wouldn’t matter what the works higher level purpose was, as long as the problem solving process was interesting. What I found was that I even though the problem-solving process was interesting I rarely ever finished work and contribute in a meaningful manner as I would become stuck and simply never have the motivation to push through. This experience truly did develop myself as both an individual and as a developer as in future I will spend more time choosing which work I participate in as I now know that I simply cannot complete work that I’m not passionate about even if there are other motivations such as grades and not letting the team down.
