## Interesting parts/Proud of
[WinScreen.cs](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/Flippy_Fish_Group/Flippy_Fish/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/UI/WinScreen.cs) (saveScore() and loadScore(), they are using Player.cs and Players.cs) is most interesting. It was involving how the multiple number of user data should be managed through programming and thinking about how to display them through responsive UI efficiently. Currently it is saving/loading the data into/from local directory. However if it is implemented with network server we can observe why script contains the part of serializing json data.
[chargeUI.cs](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/Flippy_Fish_Group/Flippy_Fish/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/UI/chargeUI.cs) is also interesting. I had to think about how I should be programming responsive UI elements according to different display ratio.


# Learning Reflection

I have learnt how to handle audio, data, UI, Game System programming in Unity. I believe I have more understanding about game development programming and game engine after finishing this project.
Also I have learnt how to communicate with group of people (amazing design students and other 2 computer science/engineering students) and managing a huge project in git environment. This project was great experience of workling with none-programmers.
The most important thing that I will use in future projects from this project is how we managing issues in git enviroment. I have never used this feature before this project and I find it is very efficent to manage/document all the issues in project.
Also audio, data management and UI programming are reuseable for most of app/game development.
